### Gameplay
### Rules
"Connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same. But, look out -- your opponent can sneak up on you and win the game!"
— Milton Bradley, Connect Four "Pretty Sneaky, Sis" television commercial, 1977

The Connect 4 Board Game Rules are easy to understand. In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.
The game is over either when you or your friend reaches four in a row, or when all forty two slots are filled, ending in a stalemate.

### How to play
The two players place red and yellow checkers in turn. To place a disk, the player must click on an available column.
The winner is the first player to connect at least four of his checkers on a row(horizontally, vertically or diagonally). If all the cells of the game grid are filled with no such alignment, the game is a draw.
